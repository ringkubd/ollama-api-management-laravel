### API Endpoints

The system provides the following API endpoints:

- `POST /api/chat`: Send chat completions requests
- `POST /api/generate`: Generate text completions
- `GET /api/models`: List available models

All API endpoints require an API key provided in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Admin Interface

The admin interface provides several sections:

- **Dashboard**: View API usage statistics and system status
- **Models**: Manage available Ollama models
- **API Keys**: Generate and manage API keys
- **Playground**: Test models directly in the browser
- **API Docs**: View API documentation
- **Users & Roles**: Manage users and role permissions

### Model Playground

The Model Playground allows administrators to:

1. Test chat models through an interactive chat interface
2. Test text generation with prompt-based inputs
3. Adjust parameters like temperature and max tokens
4. View detailed error information for debugging

## üìä System Architecture

The system is built with Laravel and includes:

- **Queue Workers**: For processing long-running AI requests
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three default roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
- **Services Layer**: Handles communication with Ollama API
- **Events System**: Supports real-time notifications via Socketi

## üîê Role-Based Access Control

The system includes three default roles:

- **Admin**: Full access to all features
- **Editor**: Can manage models and API keys, but not users or roles
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to dashboard and API documentation

## üìù API Documentation

Complete API documentation is available at `/admin/documentation` in the web interface. A Postman collection is also available for download.

## üîÑ React Native Integration

The system includes backend components to integrate with React Native applications:
